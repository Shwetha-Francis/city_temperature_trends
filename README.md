# City Temperature Trends: Analyzing Weekly Climate Patterns Using R

##  Overview
This project uses basic R programming to analyze and visualize 10 weeks of temperature data for Alappuzha. It includes temperature calculations, a simulated heatwave, and comparison with another city (Kochi). The aim is to explore how R can be used for simple real-world data analysis.

##  Objectives
- Practice using vectors, variables, and operators in R.
- Analyze weekly temperature data from a selected city.
- Simulate a heatwave by adjusting temperature values.
- Visualize data trends using line plots.
- Compare temperature patterns across cities.

##  Files Included
- `temperature.csv` – Sample weekly temperature data.
- `temperature_analysis.R` – R script with data analysis and comments.
- `temperature_analysis.Rmd` – R Markdown report (optional for presentation).

##  Key Features
- Calculates max, min, and average temperature.
- Counts weeks above 30°C.
- Identifies weeks between 25°C and 35°C.
- Simulates a +2°C heatwave effect.
- Plots smooth trend lines for better insight.

##  Tools Used
- R Programming
- Base plotting functions in R
- CSV file handling

##  How to Run
1. Open the `.R` or `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
2. Ensure `temperature.csv` is in the same folder.
3. Run the script or knit the RMarkdown file to see the results.
